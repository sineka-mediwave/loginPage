# Login Page with mailId and Password

There are 2 input fields. One for email and another for password.
They should be accessible (please google what accessibility is)
There should be a Login button.
Pressing the login button/submitting form should generate a json like {"email": "stuff-from-email-input", "password": "stuff-from-password-input"}
The email should be a valid email and password should be atleast 8 characters long and must include one of !#$^ characters in it.
If the fields dont meet that criteria, then an error should be shown below the incorrect field.
